Key points in a data science course : 

1) Type of variables (numerical, categorical - continuous, discrete)
2) What are basic operations to do once we have a dataset (calculate correlations, distribution plot, counts, info ...)
3) What kind of correlation de we have (Numerical vs numerical, numerical vs categorical, categorical vs categorical)
4) Why do we use log (logarithmic transformation) [https://dev.to/rokaandy/logarithmic-transformation-in-linear-regression-models-why-when-3a7c#:~:text=The%20Why%3A,may%20also%20be%20skewed%20negatively.]
5) How to interpret correlation coefficient ? [https://fr.khanacademy.org/math/be-5eme-secondaire2h2/x741278364a599ec1:statistiques/x741278364a599ec1:nuage-de-points-et-correlation/a/correlation-coefficient-review]
